Creating a tank vehcile within Unreal Engine

First time looking a Unreal's VehiclePawns and ChoasWheels/Plugins.

Also first time refactoring functionality into C++ after getting it to work within a blueprint.


FOR C++ (Go to Source -> Vehicle -> Private)

(Tank.cpp is the bulk of functionality for this project)




Here is the tank working ! - https://youtu.be/kPaiKcoHShI


The tank is capable of -

- Driving forwards and backwards and can steer
- Shooting a tank shell that can blow up certain environements
- Tank Shell can also damage other tanks and push them around
- Land mines that can damage the tank
- The tank will blow up at 0 HP
- Toggle camera in 3rd or 1st person
- Also controller support that provides haptic feedback when driving and feeling explosions from land mines/tank shells

All visual and audio assets for the tank were sourced online
