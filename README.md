# Unreal Engine Tank

Creating a tank vehcile within Unreal Engine 5.2.1

First time looking a Unreal's VehiclePawns and ChoasWheels/Plugins.

Also first time refactoring functionality into C++ after getting it to work within a blueprint.

([Tank.cpp](https://github.com/Brad0408/VehiclePrototyping/blob/main/Source/Vehicle/Private/Tank.cpp) is the bulk of functionality for this project)

FOR C++ (Go to Source -> Vehicle -> 'Private' & 'Public') or (https://tinyurl.com/9e5z3rdh)

Here is also a development playlist of testing newly implemented mechanics - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYBjgWvMiW73fJYIZKgGRJQZQmpUzUtOW


The tank is capable of -

- Driving forwards and backwards and can steer
- Shooting a tank shell that can blow up certain environements
- Tank Shell can also damage other tanks and push them around
- Land mines that can damage the tank
- The tank will blow up at 0 HP
- Toggle camera in 3rd or 1st person
- Also controller support that provides haptic feedback when driving and feeling explosions from land mines/tank shells

All visual and audio assets for the tank were sourced online
